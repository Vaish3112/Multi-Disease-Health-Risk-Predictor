      <h2>What is Heart Disease?</h2>
      <p>
        Heart disease is a broad term used to describe a range of conditions affecting the heart and blood vessels. The most common type is coronary artery disease (CAD), which occurs when the arteries supplying blood to the heart become narrowed or blocked due to a buildup of plaque, a condition known as atherosclerosis. Other forms include heart failure, arrhythmias (irregular heartbeat), valvular heart disease, and congenital heart defects.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 17.9 million deaths each year, accounting for 32% of all global deaths. Heart disease can affect people of all ages, though risk increases with age, unhealthy lifestyle habits, and genetic predisposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Heart disease develops gradually. Initially, patients may not notice any symptoms, but over time it can lead to chest pain, heart attacks, strokes, heart failure, and even sudden cardiac death. Understanding the disease, its causes, and preventive measures is critical for maintaining heart health.

    <!-- Section 2: Causes -->
    <section>
      <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Atherosclerosis:</strong> Plaque buildup in arteries reduces blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart muscle.</li>
        <li><strong>High Blood Pressure:</strong> Hypertension forces the heart to work harder, damaging arteries over time.</li>
        <li><strong>High Cholesterol:</strong> Elevated LDL (bad cholesterol) levels contribute to plaque formation.</li>
        <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Excess weight increases strain on the heart and is linked to other risk factors like diabetes and hypertension.</li>
        <li><strong>Smoking:</strong> Tobacco damages blood vessels, accelerates plaque buildup, and increases blood clot risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> High blood sugar levels can damage blood vessels and contribute to atherosclerosis.</li>
        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Family history of heart disease increases susceptibility.</li>
        <li><strong>Unhealthy Lifestyle:</strong> Sedentary behavior, poor diet high in saturated fats, stress, and excessive alcohol use increase risk.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3: Symptoms -->
    <section>
      <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Chest pain or discomfort (angina), often triggered by physical activity or stress.</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath, especially during exertion.</li>
        <li>Fatigue, weakness, or dizziness.</li>
        <li>Irregular heartbeat (palpitations).</li>
        <li>Swelling in legs, ankles, or feet due to fluid buildup (edema).</li>
        <li>Persistent cough or wheezing in some cases.</li>
        <li>Fainting or sudden loss of consciousness (in severe arrhythmias).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is important to recognize these symptoms early. Many people may experience mild or intermittent signs that are easy to overlook, which is why regular checkups and cardiovascular screening are essential, especially for those with risk factors.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4: Prevention / Solutions -->
    <section>
      <h2>Prevention & Management</h2>
      <p><strong>Heart disease can often be prevented or managed effectively through lifestyle changes and medical intervention:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintain a heart-healthy diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and healthy fats (like omega-3s from fish and nuts).</li>
        <li>Engage in regular physical activity: at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise per week.</li>
        <li>Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption.</li>
        <li>Keep body weight within a healthy range to reduce strain on the heart.</li>
        <li>Manage stress through meditation, yoga, deep-breathing exercises, or counseling.</li>
        <li>Monitor blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar levels regularly.</li>
        <li>Medications such as statins, beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, or aspirin may be prescribed by doctors to manage risk factors or existing conditions.</li>
        <li>Procedures such as angioplasty, stent placement, or coronary artery bypass surgery may be required in severe cases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Preventive healthcare and early intervention significantly reduce the risk of serious complications, improving life expectancy and quality of life. Education and awareness about heart disease, combined with consistent lifestyle choices, are powerful tools in maintaining cardiovascular health.

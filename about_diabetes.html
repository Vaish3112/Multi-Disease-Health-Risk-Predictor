      <h2>What is Diabetes?</h2>
      <p>
        Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. The disease occurs when the body either fails to produce sufficient insulin (Type 1 Diabetes) or cannot effectively use the insulin it produces (Type 2 Diabetes). Insulin is a hormone produced by the pancreas that regulates glucose uptake by cells to provide energy. Without proper insulin function, glucose accumulates in the blood, leading to hyperglycemia. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Diabetes affects millions worldwide. According to the International Diabetes Federation, over 537 million adults were living with diabetes in 2021, and this number is projected to rise to 783 million by 2045. Apart from Type 1 and Type 2, other forms include gestational diabetes, which develops during pregnancy, and secondary diabetes caused by certain medications or diseases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long-term uncontrolled diabetes can lead to severe complications including cardiovascular disease, kidney failure, nerve damage (neuropathy), eye damage (retinopathy), and increased susceptibility to infections. Early detection and proper management are critical for maintaining a healthy and active life.

    <!-- Section 2: Causes -->
    <section>
      <h2>Causes</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Genetic Factors:</strong> Family history plays a strong role in both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Mutations affecting insulin production or cellular glucose uptake can increase risk.</li>
        <li><strong>Unhealthy Diet:</strong> Diets high in refined sugars, processed foods, and saturated fats contribute to insulin resistance and obesity, which are major risk factors for Type 2 diabetes.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Inactivity:</strong> Sedentary lifestyles reduce muscle glucose uptake and contribute to obesity, increasing the likelihood of insulin resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Obesity and Overweight:</strong> Excess fat, especially around the abdomen, disrupts hormonal balance and increases insulin resistance.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Medical Conditions:</strong> High blood pressure, high cholesterol, and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) are associated with a higher risk of diabetes.</li>
        <li><strong>Autoimmune Factors:</strong> In Type 1 diabetes, the immune system mistakenly attacks insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas.</li>
        <li><strong>Age and Lifestyle:</strong> Type 2 diabetes is more common with advancing age and in populations with modern sedentary lifestyles and high-calorie diets.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section 3: Symptoms -->
    <section>
      <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Excessive thirst (polydipsia) and frequent urination (polyuria).</li>
        <li>Unexplained weight loss despite normal or increased appetite.</li>
        <li>Constant hunger and fatigue due to poor glucose utilization.</li>
        <li>Slow healing of cuts, wounds, and frequent infections.</li>
        <li>Blurred vision due to changes in lens shape from high blood sugar.</li>
        <li>Numbness or tingling in hands or feet (neuropathy) in prolonged cases.</li>
        <li>Gastrointestinal disturbances such as nausea or digestive problems in some cases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's important to note that Type 2 diabetes may develop slowly over years, and many people may not experience noticeable symptoms until complications arise. Regular screening is highly recommended for individuals at risk.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4: Prevention / Solutions -->
    <section>
      <h2>Prevention & Management</h2>
      <p><strong>While Type 1 diabetes cannot be prevented, Type 2 diabetes can often be delayed or prevented with lifestyle changes. Management strategies include:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Maintaining a balanced diet rich in vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and lean proteins while reducing refined sugars and saturated fats.</li>
        <li>Engaging in regular physical activity, such as brisk walking, jogging, or resistance training for at least 150 minutes per week.</li>
        <li>Keeping body weight within a healthy range to reduce insulin resistance.</li>
        <li>Monitoring blood glucose levels regularly and consulting healthcare professionals for routine check-ups.</li>
        <li>Avoiding smoking and limiting alcohol consumption, both of which can worsen complications.</li>
        <li>Managing stress through mindfulness, meditation, or yoga, as stress hormones can affect blood sugar levels.</li>
        <li>For diagnosed patients, medications such as insulin therapy, oral hypoglycemic agents, or continuous glucose monitors may be prescribed to maintain optimal glucose levels.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Early diagnosis and adherence to preventive measures significantly improve the quality of life and reduce the risk of serious complications. Education, awareness, and consistent lifestyle changes are key to controlling diabetes effectively.

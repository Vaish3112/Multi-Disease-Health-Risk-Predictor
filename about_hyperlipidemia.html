    <section>
      <h2>What is Hyperlipidemia?</h2>
      <p>
        Hyperlipidemia is a medical condition characterized by abnormally high levels of lipids (fats) in the blood, including cholesterol and triglycerides. These lipids are essential for normal body function, but excess levels can lead to plaque buildup in arteries, increasing the risk of cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart attack, and stroke.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several types of lipids: low-density lipoprotein (LDL, “bad” cholesterol), high-density lipoprotein (HDL, “good” cholesterol), and triglycerides. High LDL or triglycerides, or low HDL, contribute to atherosclerosis and arterial blockages. According to the CDC, nearly 95 million adults in the U.S. have high cholesterol, many of whom are unaware of their condition. Hyperlipidemia can be primary (genetic) or secondary due to lifestyle or other medical conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        If left untreated, hyperlipidemia can cause serious health issues such as heart attack, stroke, peripheral artery disease, and chronic kidney disease. Early detection through regular lipid profile screening is vital for effective management.

    <!-- Section 2: Causes -->
    <section>
      <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Genetic Factors:</strong> Familial hypercholesterolemia is an inherited condition leading to very high LDL levels from birth.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Diet:</strong> High intake of saturated fats, trans fats, and processed foods increases cholesterol and triglyceride levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Excess body fat contributes to higher triglyceride levels and reduced HDL cholesterol.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Inactivity:</strong> Sedentary lifestyle lowers HDL and increases LDL levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> Poorly controlled blood sugar can alter lipid metabolism, raising triglycerides and LDL cholesterol.</li>
        <li><strong>Excess Alcohol Consumption:</strong> Alcohol increases triglycerides and can worsen hyperlipidemia.</li>
        <li><strong>Underlying Medical Conditions:</strong> Hypothyroidism, kidney disease, and liver disease can contribute to abnormal lipid levels.</li>
        <li><strong>Age and Gender:</strong> Lipid levels often rise with age, and men are at higher risk at a younger age than women.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 3: Symptoms -->
    <section>
      <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        Hyperlipidemia often develops silently and may not present symptoms until complications arise. Possible indicators include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yellowish deposits of cholesterol under the skin or around the eyes (xanthomas).</li>
        <li>Chest pain (angina) due to restricted blood flow to the heart.</li>
        <li>Fatigue or weakness from reduced oxygen supply to tissues.</li>
        <li>Peripheral artery disease symptoms such as leg pain during walking.</li>
        <li>Stroke or transient ischemic attacks in severe cases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Routine screening is essential since hyperlipidemia can silently increase the risk of life-threatening cardiovascular events.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4: Prevention / Solutions -->
    <section>
      <h2>Prevention & Management</h2>
      <p><strong>Preventing and managing hyperlipidemia involves lifestyle changes and, if necessary, medications:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Adopt a heart-healthy diet low in saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol, and rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and healthy fats (like omega-3 fatty acids).</li>
        <li>Engage in regular physical activity, at least 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity exercise.</li>
        <li>Maintain a healthy body weight to improve lipid profiles.</li>
        <li>Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption.</li>
        <li>Monitor blood lipid levels regularly through routine check-ups.</li>
        <li>Medications such as statins, fibrates, niacin, or omega-3 supplements may be prescribed for individuals with high-risk lipid profiles.</li>
        <li>Manage underlying conditions such as diabetes, obesity, and thyroid disorders.</li>
        <li>Educate yourself about cholesterol and lipid health to make informed lifestyle choices.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Early intervention and consistent adherence to prevention strategies can significantly reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications and improve overall health. Awareness, lifestyle modifications, and medical management are key to controlling hyperlipidemia effectively.

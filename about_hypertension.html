      <h2>What is Hypertension?</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertension, commonly known as high blood pressure, is a chronic medical condition in which the force of the blood against the walls of the arteries is consistently too high. Blood pressure is expressed in two numbers: systolic (pressure when the heart beats) over diastolic (pressure when the heart rests). Normal blood pressure is around 120/80 mmHg, while persistent readings above 130/80 mmHg indicate hypertension.
      </p>
      <p>
        Globally, hypertension affects over 1.28 billion adults aged 30–79, and only about 1 in 5 people with high blood pressure have it under control. If left untreated, hypertension can lead to severe complications, including heart attack, stroke, kidney disease, and damage to blood vessels throughout the body.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hypertension is often called the “silent killer” because it may not show noticeable symptoms for years, even while it is damaging the heart, arteries, and other organs. Regular monitoring is crucial, especially for individuals with risk factors.

    <!-- Section 2: Causes -->
    <section>
      <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Genetics:</strong> Family history of hypertension increases the likelihood of developing high blood pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Obesity:</strong> Excess body weight increases strain on the heart and raises blood pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Poor Diet:</strong> High salt intake, excessive processed foods, and low consumption of fruits and vegetables contribute to hypertension.</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Inactivity:</strong> Sedentary lifestyles lead to weight gain and weakened cardiovascular function.</li>
        <li><strong>Excessive Alcohol:</strong> Heavy alcohol consumption raises blood pressure and damages the heart over time.</li>
        <li><strong>Stress:</strong> Chronic stress elevates stress hormones, increasing heart rate and blood pressure.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Medical Conditions:</strong> Diabetes, kidney disease, and hormonal disorders can lead to secondary hypertension.</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Blood vessels lose elasticity with age, increasing the risk of high blood pressure.</li>
      </ul>

    <!-- Section 3: Symptoms -->
    <section>
      <h2>Common Symptoms</h2>
      <p>
        Hypertension is often asymptomatic, but some individuals may experience the following signs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Persistent headaches, especially in the morning.</li>
        <li>Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.</li>
        <li>Nosebleeds, though less common.</li>
        <li>Flushing or redness of the face.</li>
        <li>Dizziness or lightheadedness.</li>
        <li>Vision problems such as blurred vision or eye strain.</li>
        <li>Chest pain in advanced cases, signaling heart strain.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Because symptoms are often subtle or absent, regular blood pressure monitoring is essential for early detection and prevention of complications.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section 4: Prevention / Solutions -->
    <section>
      <h2>Prevention & Management</h2>
      <p><strong>Hypertension can often be prevented or managed with lifestyle adjustments and medical care:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce salt intake and follow a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins.</li>
        <li>Engage in regular physical activity, including cardio exercises, walking, or swimming for at least 150 minutes per week.</li>
        <li>Maintain a healthy weight to reduce strain on the heart and blood vessels.</li>
        <li>Avoid smoking and limit alcohol consumption to moderate levels.</li>
        <li>Practice stress management techniques such as meditation, yoga, deep breathing, or counseling.</li>
        <li>Monitor blood pressure at home or at medical clinics regularly, especially if you have risk factors.</li>
        <li>Take prescribed medications consistently, which may include diuretics, ACE inhibitors, beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers.</li>
        <li>Regular medical check-ups to monitor heart, kidney, and blood vessel health.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Early detection and consistent management can prevent severe complications, improve quality of life, and reduce the risk of cardiovascular events. Education, awareness, and lifestyle changes are essential for long-term control of high blood pressure.
